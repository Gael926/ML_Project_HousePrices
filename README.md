# House Prices Prediction

Predicting house prices is a classic regression challenge.
This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end regression pipeline**, from exploratory data analysis to training a tuned model with **early stopping** for optimal performance.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used is the well-known **Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset (`train.csv` and `test.csv`).
🔗 **Source:** [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

It contains a wide range of numeric and categorical features describing residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

- **Train set**: 1,460 rows x 81 columns (including `SalePrice`)
- **Test set**: 1,459 rows x 80 columns (without `SalePrice`)
- **Target**: `SalePrice` (the house sale price in USD)

---

## Project Structure

The project has been refactored from a monolithic notebook into a modular Python pipeline found in the `src/` directory.

- `src/config.py`: Configuration constants (paths, random state).
- `src/data_loader.py`: Functions to load train and test data.
- `src/preprocessing.py`: Data cleaning, missing value imputation, feature engineering, and transformation pipelines.
- `src/training.py`: Model training logic, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost (with manual early stopping loop).
- `src/evaluation.py`: regression metrics calculation and logging.
- `main.py`: The entry point script that orchestrates the entire pipeline.

---



## Step 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The first step was to explore and understand the dataset:

- The target variable `SalePrice` is **right-skewed** (skewness ~ 1.88).
- Some columns contain **many missing values**, especially `PoolQC`, `Alley`, `Fence`, and `MiscFeature`.
- Key numerical features such as `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, and `GarageCars` show strong positive correlations with `SalePrice`.

**Missing values**

**Top correlations with SalePrice**

**Focused correlation heatmap (top features)**

## Step 2 - Preprocessing

The preprocessing workflow included several important steps, implemented in `src/preprocessing.py`:

- Dropped columns with **excessive missingness** or imputed them appropriately.
- Applied **median imputation** for numerical features and **most frequent imputation** for categorical ones.
- Encoded categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding**.
- Scaled numerical features with **StandardScaler**.
- Built a single **ColumnTransformer** to unify preprocessing and prevent data leakage.
- Applied a **log transformation** on the target (`np.log1p(SalePrice)`) to normalize it.

**Original vs log-transformed target**

After preprocessing, the dataset expanded from **75 to 274 columns** due to one-hot encoding.

## Step 3 - Models and Training

I compared several regression models to find the best performing one.

### 1. Linear Regression (Baseline)

A simple baseline model trained on the preprocessed data.
Despite its simplicity, it achieved strong performance due to the linear nature of many features.

---

### 2. Random Forest

- Tested both baseline and **RandomizedSearchCV** versions.
- Tuned hyperparameters such as `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split`.
- Results showed slightly lower accuracy than Linear Regression, indicating potential overfitting and limited benefit for this dataset.

---

### 3. XGBoost (Final Model)

The **XGBoost Regressor** was the final and best-performing model.
It was optimized in two stages:

1. **RandomizedSearchCV** for broad exploration
2. **GridSearchCV** for fine-tuning around the best parameters

**Final optimal parameters:**
```yaml
max_depth: 2
learning_rate: 0.07
n_estimators: 600
subsample: 0.74
colsample_bytree: 0.70
gamma: 0.02
reg_alpha: 0.11
reg_lambda: 0.65
```


Training used a validation split and **early stopping**:

- `num_boost_round=1000`
- `early_stopping_rounds=50`
- Best iteration: **374**

**Early stopping curve (train vs validation RMSE)**

## Step 4 - Evaluation and Results

I evaluated all models using RMSE, MAE, MedianAE, MAPE, and R2 on the test set.

| Model | RMSE | MAE | MedAE | MAPE | R2 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Linear Regression | 0.1289 | 0.0896 | 0.0602 | 0.75% | 0.9109 |
| Random Forest (Baseline) | 0.1448 | 0.0982 | 0.0665 | 0.83% | 0.8877 |
| Random Forest (Tuned) | 0.1455 | 0.0976 | 0.0640 | 0.82% | 0.8865 |
| XGBoost (Baseline) | 0.1480 | 0.0961 | 0.0642 | 0.81% | 0.8826 |
| **XGBoost (Final)** | **0.1269** | **0.0856** | **0.0605** | **0.72%** | **0.9137** |

The **final XGBoost model** achieved the lowest error and highest R2, outperforming both Random Forest and Linear Regression.

---

## Step 5 - Final Model: XGBoost with Early Stopping

The final model used **early stopping** to avoid overfitting:

- **Best iteration**: 374
- **Best RMSE (validation)**: 0.1245

The validation curve showed smooth convergence, with the validation RMSE stabilizing after ~370 rounds.

This confirms that early stopping helped the model generalize efficiently without unnecessary complexity.

---

## Step 6 - Using the Model

The final pipeline was exported using `joblib`:

`models/xgb_final_model.pkl`

Example of loading and using the model:

```python
import joblib
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the trained pipeline
model = joblib.load("models/xgb_final_model.pkl")

# Example new house data
X_new = pd.DataFrame([...])  # must have the same columns as training

# Predict log-sale prices
y_log_pred = model.predict(X_new)

# Convert back to original scale
y_pred = np.expm1(y_log_pred)
```

---

## Installation and Usage

To reproduce the results or train the model:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the automated pipeline: This script loads data, trains all models (using modular code in `src/`), and saves the final XGBoost model.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Explore via Notebook: You can also run the original comprehensive notebook for a step-by-step analysis:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/house_prices_regression.ipynb
   ```

2. Feature preprocessing with pipelines
3. Comparison of multiple models
4. Hyperparameter tuning
5. Early stopping for regularization

The final **XGBoost model** achieved an **RMSE of 0.1269** and **R2 of 0.9137**,
successfully capturing non-linear patterns while maintaining strong generalization.

By combining good preprocessing, thoughtful model tuning, and early stopping,
the project achieved a **robust and interpretable solution** for **house price prediction**.
